# About

**This GH action is beta-testing now, planned to be released Aug 2025**

Your Swiss Army knife to release software in AWS (and more) with GitHub action.
This action:
1) publish software artifacts in AWS S3, ECR, CodeArtifact; also in npmjs and [more](./docs/use-cases.md)
2) commit and push tags
3) generate GH release

![Cover](docs/images/cover.png)

Main use case ‚Äî microservices that hold application code and infrastructure code (like Terraform). Not designed/tested for monorepos.
The action generates a new version based on latest [SemVer](https://semver.org) tag and [semantic commits](./docs/semantic-release.md) `fix:`, `feat:` and `BREAKING CHANGE:`.
Then publish artifacts and push git tags, so your artifacts and git tags are in sync!

## --> [üîó All use cases](./docs/use-cases.md)

Example of publish in S3:
```yaml
on:
  push: # note that 'pull_request' and 'pull_request_target' are not supported
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  Release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      # (example) package AWS Lambda code in a .zip archive in ./s3 directory
        
      - name: Release
        uses: agilecustoms/release@v1
        with:
          aws-account: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
          aws-role: 'ci/publisher' # default
          aws-s3-bucket: 'mycompany-dist'
```
Assume:
- repo name is `mycompany/myapp`
- workflow is run `on: push` (direct push or PR merge) on a branch 'main' with latest SemVer tag `v1.2.3`
- merged branch has commit `feat: new-feature`
- you have an S3 bucket `mycompany-dist` in `us-east-1` region
- there is a role `ci/publisher` in AWS account `AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST` with permissions to upload files in this S3 bucket

The action will:
- generate a new version `v1.3.0`
- upload files from `./s3` directory to S3 bucket `mycompany-dist` at path `/myapp/v1.3.0/`
- push tag `v1.3.0` to the remote repository
- create GH Release and update CHANGELOG.md

## Artifact types and features:

Features:
- **floating tags** ‚Äî given current version is `1.2.3` and you release `1.2.4` then also create `1`, `1.2` and `latest` tags
- **idempotency** ‚Äî ability to re-run the action w/o side effects, see below for more details
- **dev-release** ‚Äî ability to publish artifacts for dev testing when testing on a local machine is impossible/complicated. More details about [release types](./docs/release-types.md)

## Action steps

1. Validate
2. Release generation
   1. generate a new version based on the latest SemVer tag + git commit messages
   2. generate release notes (write in /tmp file)
   3. update CHANGELOG.md
3. Login in AWS
4. Prepare: mainly bump versions in language-specific files
   1. update version in `pom.xml` (for maven)
   2. update version in `package.json` (for npm)
   3. update version in `pyproject.toml` (for Python) (even though it is not published in any remote repo yet)
   4. run a custom script to update arbitrary files
5. Publish artifacts
   1. AWS S3 - upload files in S3 bucket, files need to be in `./s3` directory
   2. AWS ECR - publish Docker image in ECR repository
   3. AWS CodeArtifact maven - publish maven package in CodeArtifact repository
   4. npmjs - publish npm package in public npmjs.com repository
6. Git push
   1. commit changes from step 4
   2. besides SemVer 'major.minor.patch', also add floating tags 'major', 'major.minor' and 'latest'
   3. add git notes (for prerelease)
   4. atomically push commit and refs (tags and notes) to the remote repository
7. GitHub release
   1. create a GitHub release tied to the most recent tag
8. Print summary

### Idempotency

This GH action does three modify operations: "Publish artifacts", "Git push" and "GitHub release".
Order is important to recover from failures:

- **Publish artifacts** goes first as it is the most complex (highest chances to fail).
It is idempotent, so if a later step fails, it is safe to re-run "Publish artifacts".<br>
_Note: some publish commands are not idempotent (like npm publish), so as workaround just swallow 'same version already exists' type of errors
if it is already not first workflow run (use `${{ github.run_attempt }}`)_

- **Git push** goes next as it is much simpler and less likely to fail. And it is _not_ idempotent, given "Git push" succeed,
an attempt to run it again will cause new tags creation!

- **GitHub release** goes last, as it is optional. It is also very simple ‚Äî just one command
(provided all release notes/files are generated on previous steps).
If it fails, you can create release manually through GitHub UI

## Semantic-release usage

NPM library [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release) is used to generate the next version and release notes.
It takes latest SemVer tag and analyzes commit messages to determine the next version:
commits with `fix:` prefix will increment a patch version, commits with `feat:` prefix will increment a minor version,
and commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` will increment a major version.
For more details see [semantic-release usage](./docs/semantic-release.md).

## GitHub authorization

Most of the time GitHub repos have protected branch such as `main` which requires to be made only via PRs.
At the same time, release workflow often assumes some automated changes, such as bump versions `package.json` or update `CHANGELOG.md`.
In this setup you need to **bypass** branch protection rule to make direct commit and push.
This requires a PAT ([Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)) issued by a person who has permission to bypass these branch protection rules.
So this is the main use case for `agilecustoms/release` action. For more details see [GitHub authorization](./docs/gh-authorization.md) 

```yaml
jobs:
   Release:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      permissions:
         id-token: write # need for AWS login (via GitHub OIDC provider)
         contents: read # since `id-token` is specified, now need to explicitly set `contents` permission, otherwise can't even checkout
      steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         # ...

         - name: Release
           uses: agilecustoms/release@v1
           env:
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # PAT to bypass branch protection. Create PAT and put it in repo/org secrets
```
