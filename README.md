# About

Release software artifacts in AWS (S3, ECR, CodeArtifact) and NPM with consistent versioning!

> **⚠️ Feb 9, 2026 — version 5 was released to accommodate for breaking changes in NPM made back in Dec 9, 2025, see [Migration Guide](./docs/MIGRATION.md)**

![Cover](docs/images/cover.png)

You can release **any combination** of software packages, binary files, docker images, and raw repo files

This is especially useful in microservices where the release is a _binary_ + _IaC_ versioned via git tag

## Features

- automatic and manual [version generation](./docs/features/version-generation.md)
- release notes generation and changelog update
- [floating tags](./docs/features/floating-tags.md) — given the current version is `1.2.3` and you release `1.2.4` then also create/move tags `1.2`, `1` and `latest`
- [maintenance releases](./docs/features/maintenance-release.md) — made from branch like `1.x.x` (given `2.x.x` development is in `main`)
- [prereleases](./docs/features/prerelease.md) — develop a next (often major, sometimes minor) version, typically made from a branch `next`
- [dev-release](./docs/features/dev-release.md) — ability to publish artifacts for dev testing when testing on a local machine is impossible/complicated
- [idempotency](./docs/features/idempotency.md) — ability to re-run the action without side effects
- GitHub release

## Usage

All examples are structured by [artifact types](./docs/artifact-types/index.md) and [features](./README.md#features)

The example below shows how to publish binaries in S3:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push: # note that 'pull_request' and 'pull_request_target' are not supported
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  Release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: release # has secret GH_TOKEN - a PAT with permission to bypass branch protection rule
    permissions:
      contents: read     # to checkout the code
      id-token: write    # to assume AWS role via OIDC
    steps:
      # (example) package AWS Lambda code as a zip archive in ./s3 directory
        
      - name: Release
        uses: agilecustoms/release@v5
        with:
          aws-account: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
          aws-role: 'ci/publisher'
          aws-s3-bucket: 'mycompany-dist'
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

Assume:
- you store artifacts in AWS account "Dist" and its number is stored in GH org variable `AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST`
- you have an S3 bucket `mycompany-dist` in `us-east-1` region
- there is a role `ci/publisher` with permissions to upload files in this S3 bucket and trust policy that allows to assume this role from GH action
- you have repo `mycompany/myapp`
- current release branch `main` has a protection rule so all changes must be done via PR
- you have a GH environment `release` associated with branch `main`
- There is a PAT (Personal Access Token) with permission to bypass the branch protection rule. This PAT is stored as environment secret `GH_TOKEN`
- the latest tag is `v1.2.3`

Scenario:
- a developer made a feature branch and a commit with message `feat: new-feature`
(alternatively use input [version-bump](./docs/features/version-generation.md#version-bump) for default minor/patch bump)
- the developer created and merged a PR which triggered a `Release` workflow
- build steps (omitted) produced a directory `./s3` with files (like a zip archive for AWS Lambda)

The action will:
- generate a new version `v1.3.0` (minor bump based on commit message prefix `feat:`)
- upload files from `./s3` directory to S3 bucket `mycompany-dist` at path `/myapp/v1.3.0/`
- update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
- push tags `v1.3.0`, `v1.3`, `v1` and `latest` to the remote repository
- create a GH Release tied to tag `v1.3.0`

## Ecosystem

The action comes with an **ecosystem**:
- Terraform module to create a Release-ready [GitHub repository](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/agilecustoms/repo/github/latest)
- Terraform modules to provide AWS policies to [read](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/agilecustoms/ci-builder/aws/latest) and [publish](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/agilecustoms/ci-publisher/aws/latest) artifacts
- GitHub actions to use in build workflows, e.g., [setup-maven-codeartifact](https://github.com/agilecustoms/setup-maven-codeartifact)
- documentation and examples for all supported [artifact types](./docs/artifact-types/index.md)
- [Authorization and Security](./docs/authorization.md) — how to make releases secure, including self-service (dev-releases)
- Release workflow [best practices](./docs/best-practices.md)
